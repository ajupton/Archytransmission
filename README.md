#Archytransmission

The routines provided in this repo allow for the creation of interaction networks based on morphological attributes of artifacts as a function of cultural transmission. The basic idea is to use statistical models developed by Eerkens and Bettinger (2008) to determine which artifact attributes are free to vary from site-assemblage to site-assemblage. Artifact attributes that do not vary significantly from site-assemblage to site-assemblage are considered to be more likely a product of engineering constraints, while those that do are considered to be more likely a production of social interaction through cultural transmission.
